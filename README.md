# Laboratory of Biological Data Mining

Project for the course of Laboratory Biological Data Mining held by Professor Enrico Blanzieri and Professor Toma Tebaldi (A.Y. 2023-2024).

## Topic: Human-specific genes and human diseases
Genes evolved specifically in the human lineage after the split from the lineage leading to the chimpanzee and bonobo (around 6-7 million years ago). They potentially explain huge body alterations between humans and chimpanzees, such as average height and brain size (3-fold difference) They are potentially relevant for “human-specific” diseases (Pediatric brain tumors? Pediatric leukemias?)

## Broad questions 
 * Are human-specific genes connected by causal relationships?
 * Is their expression altered in specific diseases (pediatric brain and blood cancers?)
------
Constraints: Use causal relationships among human genes obtained from the Fantom project
